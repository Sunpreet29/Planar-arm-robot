# Planar-arm-robot
A repository that integrates an MPC controller in a dual arm robot.

Status: URDF is ready alongwith the equations of motion for rigid body dynamics.
Todo: Define MPC Cost function, integrate the ROS2 controller, figure out how MPC Controller will control the end-effector position and orientatiion.
